  key |Length|
    Type integer
    Required yes
    Description The number of bytes from the beginning of the line following the keyword stream to the last byte just before the keyword endstream. (There may be an additional EOL marker, preceding endstream, that is not included in the count and is not logically part of the stream data.) See 7.3.8.2, "Stream Extent", for further discussion.
  key |Filter|
    Type name or array
    Required no

If the value is greater than 1, the filter shall assume that the data was differenced before being encoded, and Predictor selects the predictor algorithm. For more information regarding Predictor values greater than 1, see 7.4.4.4, "LZW and Flate Predictor Functions." Default value: 1.
   key |Colors|
    Type integer
    Value (May be used only if Predictor is greater than 1) The number of interleaved colour components per sample. Valid values are 1 to 4 (PDF 1.0) and 1 or greater (PDF 1.3). Default value: 1.

  key |Columns|
    Type integer
    Value The width of the image in pixels. If the value is not a multiple of 8, the filter shall adjust the width of the unencoded image to the next multiple of 8 so that each line starts on a byte boundary. Default value: 1728.
  key |Rows|
    Type integer
    Value The height of the image in scan lines. If the value is 0 or absent, the image’s height is not predetermined, and the encoded data shall be terminated by an end-of-block bit pattern or by the end of the filter’s data. Default value: 0.
  key |EndOfBlock|
    Type boolean
    Value A flag indicating whether the filter shall expect the encoded data to be terminated by an end-of-block pattern, overriding the Rows parameter. If false, the filter shall stop when it has decoded the number of lines indicated by Rows or when its data has been exhausted, whichever occurs first. The end-of-block pattern shall be the CCITT end-of-facsimile-block (EOFB) or return-to-control (RTC) appropriate for the Kparameter. Default value: true.
  key |BlackIs1|

Default value: 0.

table Table 12 – Optional parameter for the JBIG2Decode filter
  key |JBIG2Globals|
    Type stream
    Value A stream containing the JBIG2 global (page 0) segments. Global segments shall be placed in this stream even if only a single JBIG2 image XObject refers to it.

    Required no
    Value A code specifying the transformation that shall be performed on the sample values: 0 No transformation. 1 If the image has three colour components, RGB values shall be transformed to YUV before encoding and from YUV to RGB after decoding. If the image has four components, CMYK values shall be transformed to YUVK before encoding and from YUVK to CMYK after decoding. This option shall be ignored if the image has one or two colour components. If the encoding algorithm has inserted the Adobe-defined markera code in the encoded data indicating the ColorTransform value, then the colours shall be transformed, or not, after the DCT decoding has been performed according to the value provided in the encoded data and the value of this dictionary entry shall be ignored. If the Adobe- defined marker code in the encoded data indicating the ColorTransform value is not present then the value specified in this dictionary entry will be used. If the Adobe-defined marker code in the encoded data indicating the ColorTransform value is not present and this dictionary entry is not present in the filter dictionary then the default value of ColorTransform shall be 1 if the image has three components and 0 otherwise.
  key |a Parameters that control the decoding process as well as other metadata is embedded within the encoded data stream using a notation referred to as “markers”. When it defined the use of JPEG images within PostScript data streams, Adobe System Incorporated defined a particular set of rules pertaining to which markers are to be recognized, which are to be ignored and which are considered errors. A specific Adobe-defined marker was also introduced. The exact rules for producing and consuming DCT encoded data within PostScript are provide in Adobe Technical Note #5116 (reference). PDF DCT Encoding shall exactly follow those rules established by Adobe for PostScript.|

table file trailer dictionary
  key |Size|
    Type integer
    Required yes
    Value The total number of entries in the file’s cross-reference table, as defined by the combination of the original section and all update sections. Equivalently, this value shall be 1 greater than the highest object number defined in the file. Any object in a cross-reference section whose number is greater than this value shall be ignored and defined to be missing by a conforming reader.
  key |Prev|
    Type integer
    Required no

  key |Info|
    Type dictionary
    Required no
    Value The document’s information dictionary (see 14.3.3, "Document Information Dictionary").
  key |ID|
    Type array
    Required yes
    Value An array of two byte-strings constituting a file identifier (see 14.4, "File Identifiers") for the file. If there is an Encrypt entry this array and the two byte-strings shall be direct objects and shall be unencrypted. NOTE 1 Because the ID entries are not encrypted it is possible to check the ID key to assure that the correct file is being accessed without decrypting the file. The restrictions that the string be a direct object and not be encrypted assure that this is possible. NOTE 2 Although this entry is optional, its absence might prevent the file from functioning in some workflows that depend on files being uniquely identified. NOTE 3 The values of the ID strings are used as input to the encryption algorithm. If these strings were indirect, or if the ID array were indirect, these strings would be encrypted when written. This would result in a circular condition for a reader: the ID strings must be decrypted in order to use them to decrypt strings, including the ID strings themselves. The preceding restriction prevents this circular condition.

EXAMPLE [1 2 1] means that the fields are one byte, two bytes, and one byte, respectively. A value of zero for an element in the W array indicates that the corresponding field shall not be present in the stream, and the default value shall be used, if there is one. If the first element is zero, the type field shall not be present, and shall default to type 1. The sum of the items shall be the total length of each entry; it can be used with the Index array to determine the starting position of each subsection. Different cross-reference streams in a PDF file may use different values for W.

table Table 70 – Rendering Intents
  Name AbsoluteColorimetric
    Description Colours shall be represented solely with respect to the light source; no correction shall be made for the output medium’s white point (such as the colour of unprinted paper). Thus, for example, a monitor’s white point, which is bluish compared to that of a printer’s paper, would be reproduced with a blue cast. In-gamut colours shall be reproduced exactly; out-of-gamut colours shall be mapped to the nearest value within the reproducible gamut. NOTE 1 This style of reproduction has the advantage of providing exact colour matches from one output medium to another. It has the disadvantage of causing colours with Y values between the medium’s white point and 1.0 to be out of gamut. A typical use might be for logos and solid colours that require exact reproduction across different media.
  Name RelativeColorimetric
    Description Colours shall be represented with respect to the combination of the light source and the output medium’s white point (such as the colour of unprinted paper). Thus, a monitor’s white point can be reproduced on a printer by simply leaving the paper unmarked, ignoring colour differences between the two media. In-gamut colours shall be reproduced exactly; out-of-gamut colours shall be mapped to the nearest value within the reproducible gamut. NOTE 2 This style of reproduction has the advantage of adapting for the varying white points of different output media. It has the disadvantage of not providing exact colour matches from one medium to another. A typical use might be for vector graphics.
  Name Saturation
    Description Colours shall be represented in a manner that preserves or emphasizes saturation. Reproduction of in-gamut colours may or may not be colourimetrically accurate. NOTE 3 A typical use might be for business graphics, where saturation is the most important attribute of the colour.
  Name Perceptual
    Description Colours shall be represented in a manner that provides a pleasing perceptual appearance. To preserve colour relationships, both in-gamut and out-of-gamut colours shall be generally modified from their precise colourimetric values. NOTE 4 A typical use might be for scanned images.

    Value A name specifying the preferred treatment for the colour space. Values shall be DeviceN or NChannel. Default value: DeviceN.
  key |Colorants|
    Type dictionary
    Required yes
    Value A dictionary describing the individual colorants that shall be used in the DeviceN colour space. For each entry in this dictionary, the key shall be a colorant name and the value shall be an array defining a Separation colour space for that colorant (see 8.6.6.4, "Separation Colour Spaces"). The key shall match the colorant name given in that colour space. This dictionary provides information about the individual colorants that may be useful to some conforming readers. In particular, the alternate colour space and tint transformation function of a Separation colour space describe the appearance of that colorant alone, whereas those of a DeviceN colour space describe only the appearance of its colorants in combination. If Subtype is NChannel, this dictionary shall have entries for all spot colorants in this colour space. This dictionary may also include additional colorants not used by this colour space.
  key |Process|
    Type dictionary
    Required yes
    Value A dictionary (see Table 72) that describes the process colour space whose components are included in this colour space.
  key |MixingHints|
    Type dictionary

table DeviceN Process Dictionary
  KEY ColorSpace
    TYPE name or array
    Required yes
    VALUE A name or array identifying the process colour space, which may be any device or CIE-based colour space. If an ICCBased colour space is specified, it shall provide calibration information appropriate for the process colour components specified in the names array of the DeviceN colour space.
  KEY Components
    TYPE array
    Required yes
    VALUE An array of component names that correspond, in order, to the components of the process colour space specified in ColorSpace. For example, an RGB colour space shall have three names corresponding to red, green, and blue. The names may be arbitrary (that is, not the same as the standard names for the colour space components) and shall match those specified in the names array of the DeviceN colour space, even if all components are not present in the names array.

table DeviceN Mixing Hints Dictionary
  key |Solidities|
    Type dictionary
    Required no
    Value A dictionary specifying the solidity of inks that shall be used in blending calculations when used as an alternative to the tint transformation function. For each entry, the key shall be a colorant name, and the value shall be a number between 0.0 and 1.0. This dictionary need not contain entries for all colorants used in this colour space; it may also include additional colorants not used by this colour space. A value of 1.0 simulates an ink that completely covers the inks beneath; a value of 0.0 simulates a transparent ink that completely reveals the inks beneath. An entry with a key of Default specifies a value that shall be used by all components in the associated DeviceN colour space for which a solidity value is not explicitly provided. If Default is not present, the default value for unspecified colorants shall be 0.0; conforming readers may choose to use other values. If this entry is present, PrintingOrder shall also be present.
  key |PrintingOrd er|
    Type array
    Required yes
    Value An array of colorant names, specifying the order in which inks shall be laid down. Each component in the names array of the DeviceN colour space shall appear in this array (although the order is unrelated to the order specified in the names array). This entry may also list colorants unused by this specific DeviceN instance.
  key |DotGain|
    Type dictionary
    Required no
    Value A dictionary specifying the dot gain of inks that shall be used in blending calculations when used as an alternative to the tint transformation function. Dot gain (or loss) represents the amount by which a printer’s halftone dots change as the ink spreads and is absorbed by paper. For each entry, the key shall be a colorant name, and the value shall be a function that maps values in the range 0 to 1 to values in the range 0 to 1. The dictionary may list colorants unused by this specific DeviceN instance and need not list all colorants. An entry with a key of Default shall specify a function to be used by all colorants for which a dot gain function is not explicitly specified. Conforming readers may ignore values in this dictionary when other sources of dot gain information are available, such as ICC profiles associated with the process colour space or tint transformation functions associated with individual colorants.

table Table 74 – Colour Operators
  Operands name
    Operator CS
    Description (PDF 1.1) Set the current colour space to use for stroking operations. The operand name shall be a name object. If the colour space is one that can be specified by a name and no additional parameters (DeviceGray, DeviceRGB, DeviceCMYK, and certain cases of Pattern), the name may be specified directly. Otherwise, it shall be a name defined in the ColorSpace subdictionary of the current resource dictionary (see 7.8.3, "Resource Dictionaries"); the associated value shall be an array describing the colour space (see 8.6.3, "Colour Space Families"). The names DeviceGray, DeviceRGB, DeviceCMYK, and Pattern always identify the corresponding colour spaces directly; they never refer to resources in the ColorSpace subdictionary. The CS operator shall also set the current stroking colour to its initial value, which depends on the colour space: In a DeviceGray, DeviceRGB, CalGray, or CalRGB colour space, the initial colour shall have all components equal to 0.0. In a DeviceCMYK colour space, the initial colour shall be [0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0]. In a Lab or ICCBased colour space, the initial colour shall have all components equal to 0.0 unless that falls outside the intervals specified by the space’s Range entry, in which case the nearest valid value shall be substituted. In an Indexed colour space, the initial colour value shall be 0. In a Separation or DeviceN colour space, the initial tint value shall be 1.0 for all colorants. In a Pattern colour space, the initial colour shall be a pattern object that causes nothing to be painted.

The number of operands required and their interpretation depends on the current stroking colour space: For DeviceGray, CalGray, and Indexed colour spaces, one operand shall be required (n = 1). For DeviceRGB, CalRGB, and Lab colour spaces, three operands shall be required (n = 3). For DeviceCMYK, four operands shall be required (n = 4).
  Operands c1…cn c1…cn name
    Operator SCN SCN
    Description (PDF 1.2) Same as SC but also supports Pattern, Separation, DeviceN and ICCBased colour spaces. If the current stroking colour space is a Separation, DeviceN, or ICCBased colour space, the operands c1…cn shall be numbers. The number of operands and their interpretation depends on the colour space. If the current stroking colour space is a Pattern colour space, name shall be the name of an entry in the Pattern subdictionary of the current resource dictionary (see 7.8.3, "Resource Dictionaries"). For an uncoloured tiling pattern (PatternType = 1 and PaintType = 2), c1…cn shall be component values specifying a colour in the pattern’s underlying colour space. For other types of patterns, these operands shall not be specified.

table Table 75 – Additional Entries Specific to a Type 1 Pattern Dictionary
  key |Type|
    Type name
    Required no
    Value The type of PDF object that this dictionary describes; if present, shall be Pattern for a pattern dictionary.
  key |PatternType|
    Type integer
    Required yes
    Value A code identifying the type of pattern that this dictionary describes; shall be 1 for a tiling pattern.
  key |PaintType|
    Type integer
    Required yes
    Value A code that determines how the colour of the pattern cell shall be specified: a) Coloured tiling pattern. The pattern’s content stream shall specify the colours used to paint the pattern cell. When the content stream begins execution, the current colour is the one that was initially in effect in the pattern’s parent content stream. This is similar to the definition of the pattern matrix; see 8.7.2, "General Properties of Patterns". b) Uncoloured tiling pattern. The pattern’s content stream shall not specify any colour information. Instead, the entire pattern cell is painted with a separately specified colour each time the pattern is used. Essentially, the content stream describes a stencil through which the current colour shall be poured. The content stream shall not invoke operators that specify colours or other colour- related parameters in the graphics state; otherwise, an error occurs (see 8.6.8, "Colour Operators"). The content stream may paint an image mask, however, since it does not specify any colour information (see 8.9.6.2, "Stencil Masking").
  key |TilingType|
    Type integer
    Required yes
    Value A code that controls adjustments to the spacing of tiles relative to the device pixel grid: a) Constant spacing. Pattern cells shall be spaced consistently—that is, by a multiple of a device pixel. To achieve this, the conforming reader may need to distort the pattern cell slightly by making small adjustments to XStep, YStep, and the transformation matrix. The amount of distortion shall not exceed 1 device pixel. b) No distortion. The pattern cell shall not be distorted, but the spacing between pattern cells may vary by as much as 1 device pixel, both horizontally and vertically, when the pattern is painted. This achieves the spacing requested by XStep and YStep on average but not necessarily for each individual pattern cell. c) Constant spacing and faster tiling. Pattern cells shall be spaced consistently as in tiling type 1 but with additional distortion permitted to enable a more efficient implementation.
  key |BBox|
    Type rectangle
    Required yes
    Value An array of four numbers in the pattern coordinate system giving the coordinates of the left, bottom, right, and top edges, respectively, of the pattern cell’s bounding box. These boundaries shall be used to clip the pattern cell.
  key |XStep|
    Type number
    Required yes
    Value The desired horizontal spacing between pattern cells, measured in the pattern coordinate system.
  key |YStep|
    Type number
    Required yes
    Value The desired vertical spacing between pattern cells, measured in the pattern coordinate system. NOTE XStep and YStep may differ from the dimensions of the pattern cell implied by the BBox entry. This allows tiling with irregularly shaped figures. XStep and YStep may be either positive or negative but shall not be zero.
  key |Resources|
    Type dictionary
    Required yes
    Value A resource dictionary that shall contain all of the named resources required by the pattern’s content stream (see 7.8.3, "Resource Dictionaries").
  key |Matrix|
    Type array
    Required no
    Value An array of six numbers specifying the pattern matrix (see 8.7.2, "General Properties of Patterns"). Default value: the identity matrix [1 0 0 1 0 0].

    Required no
    Value The type of PDF object that this dictionary describes; if present, shall be Pattern for a pattern dictionary.
  key |PatternType|
    Type integer
    Required yes
    Value A code identifying the type of pattern that this dictionary describes; shall be 2 for a shading pattern.
  key |Shading|
    Type dictionary or stream
    Required yes
    Value A shading object (see below) defining the shading pattern’s gradient fill. The contents of the dictionary shall consist of the entries in Table 78 and those in one of Tables 79 to 84.
  key |Matrix|
    Type array
    Required no
    Value An array of six numbers specifying the pattern matrix (see 8.7.2, "General Properties of Patterns"). Default value: the identity matrix [1 0 0 1 0 0].
  key |ExtGState|
    Type dictionary
    Required no
    Value A graphics state parameter dictionary (see 8.4.5, "Graphics State Parameter Dictionaries") containing graphics state parameters to be put into effect temporarily while the shading pattern is painted. Any parameters that are so specified shall be inherited from the graphics state that was in effect at the beginning of the content stream in which the pattern is defined as a resource.

table Table 77 – Shading Operator
  Operands name
    Operator sh
    Description (PDF 1.3) Paint the shape and colour shading described by a shading dictionary, subject to the current clipping path. The current colour in the graphics state is neither used nor altered. The effect is different from that of painting a path using a shading pattern as the current colour. name is the name of a shading dictionary resource in the Shading subdictionary of the current resource dictionary (see 7.8.3, "Resource Dictionaries"). All coordinates in the shading dictionary are interpreted relative to the current user space. (By contrast, when a shading dictionary is used in a type 2 pattern, the coordinates are expressed in pattern space.) All colours are interpreted in the colour space identified by the shading dictionary’s ColorSpace entry (see Table 78). The Background entry, if present, is ignored. This operator should be applied only to bounded or geometrically defined shadings. If applied to an unbounded shading, it paints the shading’s gradient fill across the entire clipping region, which may be time-consuming.

table Table 78 – Entries Common to All Shading Dictionaries
  key |ShadingType|
    Type integer
    Required yes
    Value The shading type: 1 Function-based shading 2 Axial shading 3 Radial shading 4 Free-form Gouraud-shaded triangle mesh 5 Lattice-form Gouraud-shaded triangle mesh 6 Coons patch mesh 7 Tensor-product patch mesh
  key |ColorSpace|
    Type name or array
    Required yes
    Value The colour space in which colour values shall be expressed. This may be any device, CIE-based, or special colour space except a Pattern space. See 8.7.4.4, "Colour Space: Special Considerations" for further information.
  key |Background|
    Type array
    Required no
    Value An array of colour components appropriate to the colour space, specifying a single background colour value. If present, this colour shall be used, before any painting operation involving the shading, to fill those portions of the area to be painted that lie outside the bounds of the shading object. NOTE In the opaque imaging model, the effect is as if the painting operation were performed twice: first with the background colour and then with the shading. NOTE The background colour is applied only when the shading is used as part of a shading pattern, not when it is painted directly with the sh operator.
  key |BBox|
    Type rectangle
    Required no
    Value An array of four numbers giving the left, bottom, right, and top coordinates, respectively, of the shading’s bounding box. The coordinates shall be interpreted in the shading’s target coordinate space. If present, this bounding box shall be applied as a temporary clipping boundary when the shading is painted, in addition to the current clipping path and any other clipping boundaries in effect at that time.
  key |AntiAlias|
    Type boolean
    Required no
    Value A flag indicating whether to filter the shading function to prevent aliasing artifacts. NOTE The shading operators sample shading functions at a rate determined by the resolution of the output device. Aliasing can occur if the function is not smooth—that is, if it has a high spatial frequency relative to the sampling rate. Anti-aliasing can be computationally expensive and is usually unnecessary, since most shading functions are smooth enough or are sampled at a high enough frequency to avoid aliasing effects. Anti-aliasing may not be implemented on some output devices, in which case this flag is ignored. Default value: false.

    Value An array of six numbers specifying a transformation matrix mapping the coordinate space specified by the Domain entry into the shading’s target coordinate space. NOTE To map the domain rectangle [0.0 1.0 0.0 1.0] to a 1-inch square with lower-left corner at coordinates (100, 100) in default user space, the Matrix value would be [72 0 0 72 100 100]. Default value: the identity matrix [1 0 0 1 0 0].
  key |Function|
    Type function
    Required yes
    Value A 2-in, n-out function or an array of n 2-in, 1-out functions (where n is the number of colour components in the shading dictionary’s colour space).

    Type function
    Required yes
    Value A 1-in, n-out function or an array of n 1-in, 1-out functions (where n is the number of colour components in the shading dictionary’s colour space). The function(s) shall be called with values of the parametric variable t in the domain defined by the Domain entry. Each function’s domain shall be a superset of that of the shading dictionary. If the value returned by the function for a given colour component is out of range, it shall be adjusted to the nearest valid value.
  key |Extend|
    Type array
    Required no

  key |Domain|
    Type array
    Required no
    Value An array of two numbers [t0 t1 ] specifying the limiting values of a parametric variable t. The variable is considered to vary linearly between these two values as the colour gradient varies between the starting and ending circles.

If the element is a string, this operator shall show the string. If it is a number, the operator shall adjust the text position by that amount; that is, it shall translate the text matrix, Tm . The number shall be expressed in thousandths of a unit of text space (see 9.4.4, "Text Space Details"). This amount shall be subtracted from the current horizontal or vertical coordinate, depending on the writing mode. In the default coordinate system, a positive adjustment has the effect of moving the next glyph painted either to the left or down by the given amount. Figure 46 shows an example of the effect of passing offsets to TJ.

    Required yes
    Value The type of font; shall be Type1 for a Type 1 font.
  key |Name|
    Type name
    Required yes
    Value The name by which this font is referenced in the Font subdictionary of the current resource dictionary. This entry is obsolete and should not be used.
  key |BaseFont|
    Type name
    Required yes
    Value The PostScript name of the font. For Type 1 fonts, this is always the value of the FontName entry in the font program; for more information, see Section 5.2 of the PostScript Language Reference, Third Edition. The PostScript name of the font may be used to find the font program in the conforming reader or its environment. It is also the name that is used when printing to a PostScript output device.
  key |FirstChar|
    Type integer
    Required yes
    Value The first character code defined in the font’s Widths array. Beginning with PDF 1.5, the special treatment given to the standard 14 fonts is deprecated. Conforming writers should represent all fonts using a complete font descriptor. For backwards capability, conforming readers shall still provide the special treatment identified for the standard 14 fonts.
  key |LastChar|
    Type integer
    Required yes
    Value The last character code defined in the font’s Widths array. Beginning with PDF 1.5, the special treatment given to the standard 14 fonts is deprecated. Conforming writers should represent all fonts using a complete font descriptor. For backwards capability, conforming readers shall still provide the special treatment identified for the standard 14 fonts.
  key |Widths|
    Type array
    Required yes
    Value An array of (LastChar − FirstChar + 1) widths, each element being the glyph width for the character code that equals FirstChar plus the array index. For character codes outside the range FirstChar to LastChar, the value of MissingWidth from the FontDescriptor entry for this font shall be used. The glyph widths shall be measured in units in which 1000 units correspond to 1 unit in text space. These widths shall be consistent with the actual widths given in the font program. For more information on glyph widths and other glyph metrics, see 9.2.4, "Glyph Positioning and Metrics". Beginning with PDF 1.5, the special treatment given to the standard 14 fonts is deprecated. Conforming writers should represent all fonts using a complete font descriptor. For backwards capability, conforming readers shall still provide the special treatment identified for the standard 14 fonts.
  key |FontDescriptor|
    Type dictionary
    Required yes
    Value A font descriptor describing the font’s metrics other than its glyph widths (see 9.8, "Font Descriptors"”\). For the standard 14 fonts, the entries FirstChar, LastChar, Widths, and FontDescriptor shall either all be present or all be absent. Ordinarily, these dictionary keys may be absent; specifying them enables a standard font to be overridden; see 9.6.2.2, "Standard Type 1 Fonts (Standard 14 Fonts)". Beginning with PDF 1.5, the special treatment given to the standard 14 fonts is deprecated. Conforming writers should represent all fonts using a complete font descriptor. For backwards capability, conforming readers shall still provide the special treatment identified for the standard 14 fonts.
  key |Encoding|
    Type name or dictionary
    Required no
    Value A specification of the font’s character encoding if different from its built-in encoding. The value of Encoding shall be either the name of a predefined encoding (MacRomanEncoding, MacExpertEncoding, or WinAnsiEncoding, as described in Annex D) or an encoding dictionary that shall specify differences from the font’s built-in encoding or from a specified predefined encoding (see 9.6.6, "Character Encoding").
  key |ToUnicode|
    Type stream
    Required no
    Value A stream containing a CMap file that maps character codes to Unicode values (see 9.10, "Extraction of Text Content").

table Type 3 font dictionary
  key |Type|
    Type name
    Required yes
    Value The type of PDF object that this dictionary describes; shall be Font for a font dictionary.
  key |Subtype|
    Type name
    Required yes
    Value  The type of font; shall be Type3 for a Type 3 font.
  key |Name|
    Type name
    Required yes
    Value See Table 111.
  key |FontBBox|
    Type rectangle
    Required yes
    Value A rectangle (see 7.9.5, "Rectangles") expressed in the glyph coordinate system, specifying the font bounding box. This is the smallest rectangle enclosing the shape that would result if all of the glyphs of the font were placed with their origins coincident and then filled. If all four elements of the rectangle are zero, a conforming reader shall make no assumptions about glyph sizes based on the font bounding box. If any element is nonzero, the font bounding box shall be accurate. If any glyph’s marks fall outside this bounding box, incorrect behavior may result.
  key |FontMatrix|
    Type array
    Required yes
    Value An array of six numbers specifying the font matrix, mapping glyph space to text space (see 9.2.4, "Glyph Positioning and Metrics"). NOTE A common practice is to define glyphs in terms of a 1000-unit glyph coordinate system, in which case the font matrix is [ 0.001 0 0 0.001 0 0].
  key |CharProcs|
    Type dictionary
    Required yes
    Value  A dictionary in which each key shall be a glyph name and the value associated with that key shall be a content stream that constructs and paints the glyph for that character. The stream shall include as its first operator either d0 or d1, followed by operators describing one or more graphics objects, which may include path, text, or image objects. See below for more details about Type 3 glyph descriptions.
  key |Encoding|
    Type name or dictionary
    Required yes
    Value An encoding dictionary whose Differences array shall specify the complete character encoding for this font (see 9.6.6, "Character Encoding").
  key |FirstChar|
    Type integer
    Required yes
    Value The first character code defined in the font’s Widths array.
  key |LastChar|
    Type integer
    Required yes
    Value The last character code defined in the font’s Widths array.
  key |Widths|
    Type array
    Required yes
    Value  An array of (LastChar − FirstChar + 1) widths, each element being the glyph width for the character code that equals FirstChar plus the array index. For character codes outside the range FirstChar to LastChar, the width shall be 0. These widths shall be interpreted in glyph space as specified by FontMatrix (unlike the widths of a Type 1 font, which are in thousandths of a unit of text space). If FontMatrix specifies a rotation, only the horizontal component of the transformed width shall be used. That is, the resulting displacement shall be horizontal in text space, as is the case for all simple fonts.
  key |FontDescriptor|
    Type dictionary
    Required yes
    Value  A font descriptor describing the font’s default metrics other than its glyph widths (see 9.8, "Font Descriptors").
  key |Resources|
    Type dictionary
    Required no
    Value A list of the named resources, such as fonts and images, required by the glyph descriptions in this font (see 7.8.3, "Resource Dictionaries"). If any glyph descriptions refer to named resources but this dictionary is absent, the names shall be looked up in the resource dictionary of the page on which the font is used.
  key |ToUnicode|
    Type stream
    Required no
    Value A stream containing a CMap file that maps character codes to Unicode values (see 9.10, "Extraction of Text Content").

table Table 113 – Type 3 font operators
  Operands wx wy
    Operator d0
    Description Set width information for the glyph and declare that the glyph description specifies both its shape and its colour. NOTE This operator name ends in the digit 0. wx denotes the horizontal displacement in the glyph coordinate system; it shall be consistent with the corresponding width in the font’s Widths array. wy shall be 0 (see 9.2.4, "Glyph Positioning and Metrics"). This operator shall only be permitted in a content stream appearing in a Type 3 font’s CharProcs dictionary. It is typically used only if the glyph description executes operators to set the colour explicitly.
  Operands wx wy llx lly urx ury
    Operator d1
    Description Set width and bounding box information for the glyph and declare that the glyph description specifies only shape, not colour. NOTE This operator name ends in the digit 1. wx denotes the horizontal displacement in the glyph coordinate system; it shall be consistent with the corresponding width in the font’s Widths array. wy shall be 0 (see 9.2.4, "Glyph Positioning and Metrics"). llx and lly denote the coordinates of the lower-left corner, and urx and ury denote the upper-right corner, of the glyph bounding box. The glyph bounding box is the smallest rectangle, oriented with the axes of the glyph coordinate system, that completely encloses all marks placed on the page as a result of executing the glyph’s description. The declared bounding box shall be correct—in other words, sufficiently large to enclose the entire glyph. If any marks fall outside this bounding box, the result is unpredictable. A glyph description that begins with the d1 operator should not execute any operators that set the colour (or other colour-related parameters) in the graphics state; any use of such operators shall be ignored. The glyph description is executed solely to determine the glyph’s shape. Its colour shall be determined by the graphics state in effect each time this glyph is painted by a text-showing operator. For the same reason, the glyph description shall not include an image; however, an image mask is acceptable, since it merely defines a region of the page to be painted with the current colour. This operator shall be used only in a content stream appearing in a Type 3 font’s CharProcs dictionary.

table encoding dictionary

    Required no
    Value The base encoding—that is, the encoding from which the Differences entry (if present) describes differences— shall be the name of one of the predefined encodings MacRomanEncoding, MacExpertEncoding, or WinAnsiEncoding (see Annex D). If this entry is absent, the Differences entry shall describe differences from an implicit base encoding. For a font program that is embedded in the PDF file, the implicit base encoding shall be the font program’s built-in encoding, as described in 9.6.6, "Character Encoding" and further elaborated in the sub-clauses on specific font types. Otherwise, for a nonsymbolic font, it shall be StandardEncoding, and for a symbolic font, it shall be the font’s built-in encoding.
  key |Differences|
    Type array
    Required no
    Value An array describing the differences from the encoding specified by BaseEncoding or, if BaseEncoding is absent, from an implicit base encoding. The Differences array is described in subsequent sub-clauses.

  key |Supplement|
    Type integer
    Required yes
    Value The supplement number of the character collection. An original character collection has a supplement number of 0. Whenever additional CIDs are assigned in a character collection, the supplement number shall be increased. Supplements shall not alter the ordering of existing CIDs in the character collection. This value shall not be used in determining compatibility between character collections.

table Table 120 – Additional entries in a CMap stream dictionary
  key |Type|

    Value The name of the CMap. It shall be the same as the value of CMapName in the CMap file.
  key |CIDSystemInfo|
    Type dictionary
    Required yes
    Value A dictionary (see 9.7.3, "CIDSystemInfo Dictionaries") containing entries that define the character collection for the CIDFont or CIDFonts associated with the CMap. The value of this entry shall be the same as the value of CIDSystemInfo in the CMap file. (However, it does not need to match the values of CIDSystemInfo for the Identity-H or Identity-V CMaps.)
  key |WMode|
    Type integer
    Required no
    Value A code that specifies the writing mode for any CIDFont with which this CMap is combined. The value shall be 0 for horizontal or 1 for vertical. Default value: 0. The value of this entry shall be the same as the value of WMode in the CMap file.
  key |UseCMap|
    Type name or stream

  key |BaseFont|
    Type name
    Required yes
    Value The name of the font. If the descendant is a Type 0 CIDFont, this name should be the concatenation of the CIDFont’s BaseFont name, a hyphen, and the CMap name given in the Encoding entry (or the CMapName entry in the CMap). If the descendant is a Type 2 CIDFont, this name should be the same as the CIDFont’s BaseFont name. NOTE In principle, this is an arbitrary name, since there is no font program associated directly with a Type 0 font dictionary. The conventions described here ensure maximum compatibility with existing readers.
  key |Encoding|
    Type name or stream
    Required yes
    Value The name of a predefined CMap, or a stream containing a CMap that maps character codes to font numbers and CIDs. If the descendant is a Type 2 CIDFont whose associated TrueType font program is not embedded in the PDF file, the Encoding entry shall be a predefined CMap name (see 9.7.4.2, "Glyph Selection in CIDFonts").
  key |DescendantFonts|
    Type array
    Required yes
    Value A one-element array specifying the CIDFont dictionary that is the descendant of this Type 0 font.
  key |ToUnicode|
    Type stream

It shall be one of these names (ordered from narrowest to widest): UltraCondensed, ExtraCondensed, Condensed, SemiCondensed, Normal, SemiExpanded, Expanded, ExtraExpanded or UltraExpanded. The specific interpretation of these values varies from font to font. EXAMPLE 2 Condensed in one font may appear most similar to Normal in another.
  key |FontWeight|
    Type number
    Required no
    Value The weight (thickness) component of the fully-qualified font name or font specifier. The possible values shall be 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, or 900, where each number indicates a weight that is at least as dark as its predecessor. A value of 400 shall indicate a normal weight; 700 shall indicate bold. The specific interpretation of these values varies from font to font. EXAMPLE 3 300 in one font may appear most similar to 500 in another.
  key |Flags|
    Type integer
    Required yes
    Value A collection of flags defining various characteristics of the font (see 9.8.2, "Font Descriptor Flags").
  key |FontBBox|
    Type rectangle
    Required yes
    Value A rectangle (see 7.9.5, "Rectangles"), expressed in the glyph coordinate system, that shall specify the font bounding box.

table Table 136 – Standard separable blend modes
  Name Normal
    Result B ( cb , cs ) = cs NOTE Selects the source colour, ignoring the backdrop.
  Name Compatible
    Result Same as Normal. This mode exists only for compatibility and should not be used.
  Name Multiply
    Result B ( cb , cs ) = cb × cs NOTE 1 Multiplies the backdrop and source colour values. NOTE 2 The result colour is always at least as dark as either of the two constituent colours. Multiplying any colour with black produces black; multiplying with white leaves the original colour unchanged. Painting successive overlapping objects with a colour other than black or white produces progressively darker colours.
  Name Screen
    Result B ( cb , cs ) = 1 – [(1 – cb) × (1 – cs)] = cb + cs – (cb × cs) NOTE 3 Multiplies the complements of the backdrop and source colour values, then complements the result. NOTE 4 The result colour is always at least as light as either of the two constituent colours. Screening any colour with white produces white; screening with black leaves the original colour unchanged. The effect is similar to projecting multiple photographic slides simultaneously onto a single screen.
  Name Overlay
    Result B(cb, cs) = HardLight(cs, cb) NOTE 5 Multiplies or screens the colours, depending on the backdrop colour value. Source colours overlay the backdrop while preserving its highlights and shadows. The backdrop colour is not replaced but is mixed with the source colour to reflect the lightness or darkness of the backdrop.
  Name Darken
    Result B ( cb , cs ) = min ( cb , cs ) NOTE 6 Selects the darker of the backdrop and source colours. NOTE 7 The backdrop is replaced with the source where the source is darker; otherwise, it is left unchanged.
  Name Lighten
    Result B ( cb , cs ) = max ( cb , cs ) NOTE 8 Selects the lighter of the backdrop and source colours. NOTE 9 The backdrop is replaced with the source where the source is lighter; otherwise, it is left unchanged.
  Name ColorDodge
    Result ⎧min(1, cb ⁄ (1 – cs)) if cs < 1 B(cb, cs) = ⎨1 if c = ⎩ s NOTE 10 Brightens the backdrop colour to reflect the source colour. Painting with black produces no changes.
  Name ColorBurn
    Result ⎧1 – min(1, (1 – cb) ⁄ cs) if cs > 0 B(cb, cs) = ⎨0 if c = ⎩ s NOTE 11 Darkens the backdrop colour to reflect the source colour. Painting with white produces no change.
  Name HardLight
    Result ⎧Multiply(cb, 2 × cs) if cs ≤ 0.5 B(cb, cs) = ⎨Screen(c , 2 × c – 1) if c > 0.5 ⎩ b s s NOTE 12 Multiplies or screens the colours, depending on the source colour value. The effect is similar to shining a harsh spotlight on the backdrop.
  Name SoftLight
    Result ⎧cb – (1 – 2 × cs) × cb × (1 – cb) if cs ≤ 0. B(cb, cs) = ⎨c + (2 × c – 1) × (D(c ) – c ) if c > 0. ⎩ b s b b s where ⎧((16 × x – 12) × x + 4) × x if x ≤ 0.25 D(x) = ⎨ ⎩ x if x > 0.25 NOTE 13 Darkens or lightens the colours, depending on the source colour value. The effect is similar to shining a diffused spotlight on the backdrop.
  Name Difference
    Result B ( cb , cs ) = cb – cs NOTE 14 Subtracts the darker of the two constituent colours from the lighter colour: NOTE 15 Painting with white inverts the backdrop colour; painting with black produces no change.
  Name Exclusion
    Result B(cb, cs) = cb + cs – 2 × cb × c NOTE 16 Produces an effect similar to that of the Difference mode but lower in contrast. Painting with white inverts the backdrop colour; painting with black produces no change.

table Table 137 – Standard nonseparable blend modes
  Name Hue
    Result B(Cb, Cs) = SetLum(SetSat(Cs, Sat(Cb)), Lum(Cb)) NOTE 1 Creates a colour with the hue of the source colour and the saturation and luminosity of the backdrop colour.
  Name Saturation
    Result B(Cb, Cs) = SetLum(SetSat(Cb, Sat(Cs)), Lum(Cb)) NOTE 2 Creates a colour with the saturation of the source colour and the hue and luminosity of the backdrop colour. Painting with this mode in an area of the backdrop that is a pure gray (no saturation) produces no change.
  Name Color
    Result B(Cb, Cs) = SetLum(Cs, Lum(Cb)) NOTE 3 Creates a colour with the hue and saturation of the source colour and the luminosity of the backdrop colour. This preserves the gray levels of the backdrop and is useful for colouring monochrome images or tinting colour images.
  Name Luminosity
    Result B(Cb, Cs) = SetLum(Cb, Lum(Cs)) NOTE 4 Creates a colour with the luminosity of the source colour and the hue and saturation of the backdrop colour. This produces an inverse effect to that of the Color mode.

If it is determined to be invisible, the annotation shall be skipped, as if it were not in the document.

table Table 165 – Annotation flags
  Bit position 1
    Name Invisible
    Meaning If set, do not display the annotation if it does not belong to one of the standard annotation types and no annotation handler is available. If clear, display such an unknown annotation using an appearance stream specified by its appearance dictionary, if any (see 12.5.5, “Appearance Streams”).
  Bit position 2
    Name Hidden
    Meaning (PDF 1.2) If set, do not display or print the annotation or allow it to interact with the user, regardless of its annotation type or whether an annotation handler is available. NOTE 1 In cases where screen space is limited, the ability to hide and show annotations selectively can be used in combination with appearance streams (see 12.5.5, “Appearance Streams”) to display auxiliary pop-up information similar in function to online help systems.
  Bit position 3
    Name Print
    Meaning (PDF 1.2) If set, print the annotation when the page is printed. If clear, never print the annotation, regardless of whether it is displayed on the screen. NOTE 2 This can be useful for annotations representing interactive pushbuttons, which would serve no meaningful purpose on the printed page.
  Bit position 4
    Name NoZoom
    Meaning (PDF 1.3) If set, do not scale the annotation’s appearance to match the magnification of the page. The location of the annotation on the page (defined by the upper-left corner of its annotation rectangle) shall remain fixed, regardless of the page magnification. See further discussion following this Table.
  Bit position 5
    Name NoRotate
    Meaning (PDF 1.3) If set, do not rotate the annotation’s appearance to match the rotation of the page. The upper-left corner of the annotation rectangle shall remain in a fixed location on the page, regardless of the page rotation. See further discussion following this Table.
  Bit position 6
    Name NoView
    Meaning (PDF 1.3) If set, do not display the annotation on the screen or allow it to interact with the user. The annotation may be printed (depending on the setting of the Print flag) but should be considered hidden for purposes of on-screen display and user interaction.
  Bit position 7
    Name ReadOnly
    Meaning (PDF 1.3) If set, do not allow the annotation to interact with the user. The annotation may be displayed or printed (depending on the settings of the NoView and Print flags) but should not respond to mouse clicks or change its appearance in response to mouse motions. This flag shall be ignored for widget annotations; its function is subsumed by the ReadOnly flag of the associated form field (see Table 221).
  Bit position 8
    Name Locked
    Meaning (PDF 1.4) If set, do not allow the annotation to be deleted or its properties (including position and size) to be modified by the user. However, this flag does not restrict changes to the annotation’s contents, such as the value of a form field.
  Bit position 9
    Name ToggleNoView
    Meaning (PDF 1.5) If set, invert the interpretation of the NoView flag for certain events. NOTE 3 A typical use is to have an annotation that appears only when a mouse cursor is held over it.
  Bit position 10
    Name LockedContents
    Meaning (PDF 1.7) If set, do not allow the contents of the annotation to be modified by the user. This flag does not restrict deletion of the annotation or changes to other annotation properties, such as position and size.

B (Beveled) A simulated embossed rectangle that appears to be raised above the surface of the page. I (Inset) A simulated engraved rectangle that appears to be recessed below the surface of the page. U (Underline) A single line along the bottom of the annotation rectangle. A conforming reader shall tolerate other border styles that it does not recognize and shall use the default value.
  key |D|
    Type array
    Required no
    Value A dash array defining a pattern of dashes and gaps that shall be used in drawing a dashed border (border style D in the S entry). The dash array shall be specified in the same format as in the line dash pattern parameter of the graphics state (see 8.4.3.6, “Line Dash Pattern”). The dash phase is not specified and shall be assumed to be 0. EXAMPLE A D entry of [3 2] specifies a border drawn with 3-point dashes alternating with 2-point gaps. Default value: [ 3].

    Value A resource dictionary (see 7.8.3, “Resource Dictionaries”) containing default resources (such as fonts, patterns, or colour spaces) that shall be used by form field appearance streams. At a minimum, this dictionary shall contain a Font entry specifying the resource name and font dictionary of the default font for displaying text.
  key |DA|
    Type string
    Required no

table Table 219 – Signature flags
  Bit position 1
    Name SignaturesExist
    Meaning If set, the document contains at least one signature field. This flag allows a conforming reader to enable user interface items (such as menu items or pushbuttons) related to signature processing without having to scan the entire document for the presence of signature fields.
  Bit position 2
    Name AppendOnly
    Meaning If set, the document contains signatures that may be invalidated if the file is saved (written) in a way that alters its previous contents, as opposed to an incremental update. Merely updating the file by appending new information to the end of the previous version is safe (see H.7, “Updating Example”). Conforming readers may use this flag to inform a user requesting a full save that signatures will be invalidated and require explicit confirmation before continuing with the operation.

table Table 220 – Entries common to all field dictionaries
  key |FT|
    Type name
    Required yes
    Value The type of field that this dictionary describes: Btn Button (see 12.7.4.2, “Button Fields”) Tx Text (see 12.7.4.3, “Text Fields”) Ch Choice (see 12.7.4.4, “Choice Fields”) Sig (PDF 1.3) Signature (see 12.7.4.5, “Signature Fields”) This entry may be present in a non-terminal field (one whose descendants are fields) to provide an inheritable FT value. However, a non-terminal field does not logically have a type of its own; it is merely a container for inheritable attributes that are intended for descendant terminal fields of any type.
  key |Parent|
    Type dictionary
    Required yes

    Required yes
    Value (Sometimes required, as described below) An array of indirect references to the immediate children of this field. In a non-terminal field, the Kids array shall refer to field dictionaries that are immediate descendants of this field. In a terminal field, the Kids array ordinarily shall refer to one or more separate widget annotations that are associated with this field. However, if there is only one associated widget annotation, and its contents have been merged into the field dictionary, Kids shall be omitted.
  key |T|
    Type text string
    Required no
    Value The partial field name (see 12.7.3.2, “Field Names”).
  key |TU|
    Type text string
    Required no
    Value An alternate field name that shall be used in place of the actual field name wherever the field shall be identified in the user interface (such as in error or status messages referring to the field).

    Value An additional-actions dictionary defining the field’s behaviour in response to various trigger events (see 12.6.3, “Trigger Events”). This entry has exactly the same meaning as the AA entry in an annotation dictionary (see 12.5.2, “Annotation Dictionaries”).

table Table 221 – Field flags common to all field types
  Bit position 1
    Name ReadOnly
    Meaning If set, the user may not change the value of the field. Any associated widget annotations will not interact with the user; that is, they will not respond to mouse clicks or change their appearance in response to mouse motions. This flag is useful for fields whose values are computed or imported from a database.
  Bit position 2
    Name Required
    Meaning If set, the field shall have a value at the time it is exported by a submit- form action (see 12.7.5.2, “Submit-Form Action”).
  Bit position 3
    Name NoExport

  Bit position 26
    Name RadiosInUnison
    Meaning (PDF 1.5) If set, a group of radio buttons within a radio button field that use the same value for the on state will turn on and off in unison; that is if one is checked, they are all checked. If clear, the buttons are mutually exclusive (the same behavior as HTML radio buttons).

table Table 228 – Field flags specific to text fields
  Bit position 13
    Name Multiline
    Meaning If set, the field may contain multiple lines of text; if clear, the field’s text shall be restricted to a single line.
  Bit position 14
    Name Password
    Meaning If set, the field is intended for entering a secure password that should not be echoed visibly to the screen. Characters typed from the keyboard shall instead be echoed in some unreadable form, such as asterisks or bullet characters. NOTE To protect password confidentiality, readers should never store the value of the text field in the PDF file if this flag is set.
  Bit position 21
    Name FileSelect
    Meaning (PDF 1.4) If set, the text entered in the field represents the pathname of a file whose contents shall be submitted as the value of the field.
  Bit position 23
    Name DoNotSpellCheck
    Meaning (PDF 1.4) If set, text entered in the field shall not be spell-checked.
  Bit position 24
    Name DoNotScroll
    Meaning (PDF 1.4) If set, the field shall not scroll (horizontally for single-line fields, vertically for multiple-line fields) to accommodate more text than fits within its annotation rectangle. Once the field is full, no further text shall be accepted for interactive form filling; for non- interactive form filling, the filler should take care not to add more character than will visibly fit in the defined area.
  Bit position 25
    Name Comb
    Meaning (PDF 1.5) May be set only if the MaxLen entry is present in the text field dictionary (see Table 229) and if the Multiline, Password, and FileSelect flags are clear. If set, the field shall be automatically divided into as many equally spaced positions, or combs, as the value of MaxLen, and the text is laid out into those combs.
  Bit position 26
    Name RichText
    Meaning (PDF 1.5) If set, the value of this field shall be a rich text string (see 12.7.3.4, “Rich Text Strings”). If the field has a value, the RV entry of the field dictionary (Table 222) shall specify the rich text string.

  key |MaxLen|
    Type integer
    Required no
    Value The maximum length of the field’s text, in characters.

table Table 230 – Field flags specific to choice fields
  Bit position 18
    Name Combo
    Meaning If set, the field is a combo box; if clear, the field is a list box.
  Bit position 19
    Name Edit
    Meaning If set, the combo box shall include an editable text box as well as a drop-down list; if clear, it shall include only a drop-down list. This flag shall be used only if the Combo flag is set.
  Bit position 20
    Name Sort
    Meaning If set, the field’s option items shall be sorted alphabetically. This flag is intended for use by writers, not by readers. Conforming readers shall display the options in the order in which they occur in the Opt array (see Table 231).

  Bit position 23
    Name DoNotSpellCheck
    Meaning (PDF 1.4) If set, text entered in the field shall not be spell- checked. This flag shall not be used unless the Combo and Edit flags are both set.
  Bit position 27
    Name CommitOnSelChange
    Meaning (PDF 1.5) If set, the new value shall be committed as soon as a selection is made (commonly with the pointing device). In this case, supplying a value for a field involves three actions: selecting the field for fill-in, selecting a choice for the fill-in value, and leaving that field, which finalizes or “commits” the data choice and triggers any actions associated with the entry or changing of this data. If this flag is on, then processing does not wait for leaving the field action to occur, but immediately proceeds to the third step. This option enables applications to perform an action once a selection is made, without requiring the user to exit the field. If clear, the new value is not committed until the user exits the field.

table Table 231 – Additional entries specific to a choice field
  key |Opt|
    Type array
    Required no
    Value An array of options that shall be presented to the user. Each element of the array is either a text string representing one of the available options or an array consisting of two text strings: the option’s export value and the text that shall be displayed as the name of the option. If this entry is not present, no choices should be presented to the user.
  key |TI|
    Type integer
    Required no
    Value For scrollable list boxes, the top index (the index in the Opt array of the first option visible in the list). Default value: 0.
  key |I|
    Type array
    Required yes
    Value For choice fields that allow multiple selection (MultiSelect flag set), an array of integers, sorted in ascending order, representing the zero-based indices in the Opt array of the currently selected option items. This entry shall be used when two or more elements in the Opt array have different names but the same export value or when the value of the choice field is an array. This entry should not be used for choice fields that do not allow multiple selection. If the items identified by this entry differ from those in the V entry of the field dictionary (see discussion following this Table), the V entry shall be used.

table Table 232 – Additional entries specific to a signature field
  key |Lock|
    Type dictionary

    Value A flag indicating whether revocation checking shall be carried out. If AddRevInfo is true, the conforming processor shall perform the following additional tasks when signing the signature field: Perform revocation checking of the certificate (and the corresponding issuing certificates) used to sign. Include the revocation information within the signature value. Three SubFilter values have been defined for ISO 32000. For those values the AddRevInfo value shall be true only if SubFilter is adbe.pkcs7.detached or adbe.pkcs7.sha1. If SubFilter is x509.rsa_sha1, this entry shall be omitted or set to false. Additional SubFilters may be defined that also use AddRevInfo values. If AddRevInfo is true and the Ff entry indicates this is a required constraint, then the preceding tasks shall be performed. If they cannot be performed, then signing shall fail. Default value: false NOTE 1 Revocation information is carried in the signature data as specified by PCKS#7. See 12.8.3.3, "PKCS#7 Signatures as used in ISO 32000". NOTE 2 The trust anchors used are determined by the signature handlers for both creation and validation.

The first through ninth characters in the string, from left to right, represent the required value for the following key-usage extensions: 1 digitalSignature 4 dataEncipherment 7 cRLSign 2 non-Repudiation 5 keyAgreement 8 encipherOnly 3 keyEncipherment 6 keyCertSign 9 decipherOnly Any additional characters shall be ignored. Any missing characters or characters that are not one of the following values, shall be treated as ‘X’. The following character values shall be supported: 0 Corresponding key-usage shall not be set. 1 Corresponding key-usage shall be set. X State of the corresponding key-usage does not matter. EXAMPLE 1 The string values ‘1’ and ‘1XXXXXXXX’ represent settings where the key-usage type digitalSignature is set and the state of all other key-usage types do not matter. The value of the corresponding flag in the Ff entry indicates whether this is a required constraint.
  key |Issuer|
    Type array
    Required no
    Value An array of byte strings containing DER-encoded X.509v3 certificates of acceptable issuers. If the signer’s certificate refers to any of the specified issuers (either directly or indirectly), the certificate shall be considered acceptable for signing.

    Name SubmitCoordinates
    Meaning If set, the coordinates of the mouse click that caused the submit-form action shall be transmitted as part of the form data. The coordinate values are relative to the upper-left corner of the field’s widget annotation rectangle. They shall be represented in the data in the format name .x=xval&name.y=yval where name is the field’s mapping name (TM in the field dictionary) if present; otherwise, name is the field name. If the value of the TM entry is a single ASCII SPACE (20h) character, both the name and the ASCII PERIOD (2Eh) following it shall be suppressed, resulting in the format x=xval&y=yval This flag shall be used only when the ExportFormat flag is set. If ExportFormat is clear, this flag shall also be clear.
  Bit position 6
    Name XFDF
    Meaning (PDF 1.4) shall be used only if the SubmitPDF flags are clear. If set, field names and values shall be submitted as XFDF.
  Bit position 7

    Name ExclNonUserAnnots
    Meaning (PDF 1.4) shall be used only when the form is being submitted in Forms Data Format (that is, when both the XFDF and ExportFormat flags are clear) and the IncludeAnnotations flag is set. If set, it shall include only those markup annotations whose T entry (see Table 170) matches the name of the current user, as determined by the remote server to which the form is being submitted. NOTE 2 The T entry for markup annotations specifies the text label that is displayed in the title bar of the annotation’s pop-up window and is assumed to represent the name of the user authoring the annotation. NOTE 3 This allows multiple users to collaborate in annotating a single remote PDF document without affecting one another’s annotations.
  Bit position 12
    Name ExclFKey
    Meaning (PDF 1.4) shall be used only when the form is being submitted in Forms Data Format (that is, when both the XFDF and ExportFormat flags are clear). If set, the submitted FDF shall exclude the F entry.
